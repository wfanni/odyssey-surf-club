# Odyssey Surfers Club - Part I

## Story

You (the team) just founded a small creative developer agency.
You had a few successful projects, but you had been waiting for your big chance to prove your skills.
The big opportunity is here:
A youthful, booming, innovative surf club are looking forward to create their new website.
They accepted your team's offer. Their UI/UX designer is really famous so it will be a pretty good reference in your portfolio.

Unfortunately, it turned out that the designer barely finished the work and left for holiday so you have to prepare the project's graphics for development. Your team have to recreate the design in HTML/SVG/CSS.
You have to choose which part will become HTML, inline SVG code or SVG file, the goal is to have a web page that looks like the template.
Also your client asked a small favour: they have two video footage, they would like to use it at the welcome section.

## What are you going to learn?

- Using vector graphics
- Embed videos into html
- Ember svg into html
- Modern web design
- Create Build from AI files

## Tasks

1. Recreate the UI design as an HTML page. The CSS properties of the different elements must match with those from the UI design.
    - The page looks like this: [Odyssey Surfers Club](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gctGcFgbXyNsU5FqNjFuuoblsIc5BY25/view?usp=sharing)
You can download the UI design from here: [Illustrator file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UXrcZ2gEXEbEBJj5jy838KQG5UE103LE/view?usp=sharing)
    - The welcome section (the first circa 900px from the top of the artboard in the UI design) is fixed when the page scrolling
    - The icons and illustration (world map) are inlined into the html with `<svg>` tag
    - The `<html>` and `<svg>` codes style with css and do not contain inline styling

2. Create and embed a video as the background of the first (welcome) section
    - An intoductional video created from (at least) these two videos: [Video 1 Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1INXsltRM-QUY6vlDkGChMKW8QjCUztQe/view?usp=sharing) [Video 2 Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xV4cdrTRhnLVnL4Nu_eUteFfO-w3VYlP/view?usp=sharing)
    - The video resolution and size is optimized for webview
    - The video is embed as the background of the first (welcome) section of the page

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You don't have to animate any parts of the build nor care about responsivity
- You can download fonts from Google Fonts and install it to your computer. Use google search to found out how.
- Take care and read out every parameter from the Illustrator file. Font-weight, font-size, space-lining, position etc...
- Before you start to work with the `<svg>` parts, create the structure of the layout with html and css also create placeholder `<div>`s for the `<svg>` parts
